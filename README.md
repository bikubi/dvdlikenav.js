# dvdlikenav.js

Navigate a movie like it has a DVD menu: add buttons and point them to regions.

Runs in a browser, intended for touch screen displays.

## Requirements

* A video-capable browser. Only tested in Chrome/-ium.
* A video that can be played with this browser (like h264 in a mp4 container).
* Everything (all scenes, a menu) have to be in one long movie.
* For `make-example-movie.sh`: imagemagick, ffmpeg, bash.

## Usage

* Create a `cfg.js`. See `cfg-example.js`.
  * It is basically an array of scenes
  * Each scene has a start/end-marker (in seconds).
  * Each scene can have an array of buttons
  * Each button has coordinates (expressed in fractions [0..1.0]) and a target scene
  * A 'menu' scene should probably `idleAtEnd`.
  * Note: all scenes can have buttons, like a 'back' button that targets the `start` scene.
* Copy all files to your device and open via file://. You can also run this over a network - it worked surprisingly well over WiFi with a 1GB+ movie.
* Append `#debug` to the URL to enable debug mode which visualizes borders, buttons and shows timecode and state.

## Example usage

```
sh make-example-movie.sh # should create example.mp4
cp cfg-example.js cfg.js
xdg-open ./index.html
```

## Video considerations

* You might notice jumps/lag/delays. I tried a version with two overlaying `<video>`s that would pre-jump and blit, but in the end a sufficiently small [GOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_pictures) (â‰¤5) did the trick. Strategically placed keyframes/scenecuts might do the trick even better.
* Also consider `tune=fastdecode` etc.
* Video aspect ratio has to match the display/window size, otherwise the buttons won't fit. Check with `#debug`.
